# Minesweeper in Java

This is a project to implement the classic Minesweeper game in Java, using the Observer pattern and the Swing library for the graphical interface.

## Description

Minesweeper is a puzzle game where the player uncovers cells on a board, avoiding hidden bombs. In this project, the game is built with Java, offering an interactive and challenging gaming experience.

## Features

- **Observer Pattern**: The Observer pattern is used to notify the graphical interface about changes in the game state, ensuring dynamic updates to the interface as the player takes actions.

- **Swing Library**: The graphical interface is built with the Swing library, offering graphical components such as buttons and panels for intuitive interaction with the game.

- **Game Board**: The Minesweeper board is represented by a matrix of cells, where each cell can be empty or contain a bomb, with the number of adjacent bombs displayed.

- **Mouse Events**: Mouse events are captured to allow the player to interact with the board, such as revealing cells and marking cells suspected of containing bombs.

- **Visual Feedback**: The graphical interface provides visual feedback to the player, indicating the state of the cells on the board, such as revealed cells, marked cells, or cells with bombs.
